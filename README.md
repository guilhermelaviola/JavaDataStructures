# JavaDataStructures
Examples of Linear and Hierarchical Data Structures in Java (Stack, Queue, LinkedList and HashMap).

##Linear
A linear data structure is one where data items are arranged in a linear fashion. Each member is attached to its neighboring elements. The structure permits single-level data storage because the data elements are stored in a linear fashion. The data can be traversed in one run.
###Queue
Queue is an abstract data structure, somewhat similar to Stacks. Unlike stacks, a queue is open at both its ends. One end is always used to insert data (enqueue) and the other is used to remove data (dequeue). Queue follows First-In-First-Out methodology, i.e., the data item stored first will be accessed first.
###Linked List
A linked list is the most sought-after data structure when it comes to handling dynamic data elements. A linked list consists of a data element known as a node. And each node consists of two fields: one field has data, and in the second field, the node has an address that keeps a reference to the next node.
###Stack
The stack data structure is a linear data structure that accompanies a principle known as LIFO (Last In First Out) or FILO (First In Last Out). Real-life examples of a stack are a deck of cards, piles of books, piles of money, and many more.

##Hierarchical
Hierarchical data is a data structure when items are linked to each other in parent-child relationships in an overall tree structure. Think of data like a family tree, with grandparents, parents, children, and grandchildren forming a hierarchy of connected data.
###Hashmap
HashMap in Java is a part of the collections framework, which is found in java. util package. It provides the basic implementation of Map interface of Java. It stores the data in a key-value mapping in which every key is mapped to exactly one value of any data type.

##Binary Tree
A binary tree is a rooted tree that is also an ordered tree (a.k.a. plane tree) in which every node has at most two children. A rooted tree naturally imparts a notion of levels (distance from the root), thus for every node a notion of children may be defined as the nodes connected to it a level below.
